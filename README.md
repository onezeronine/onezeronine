### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I usually work in Python, Javascript, Postgresql, Linux and Go from my recent stint in Aqwire. Before then, I write in C#, Java, Kotlin and C++ with a sprinkle of some Windows administration. But that was a long time ago.

Currently, I am passionate in photography. Check my website if you are curious: [https://onezeronine.dev/](https://onezeronine.dev/)
