### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Full Stack software engineer in AI for Finance using FastAPI, React, and multiple LLM integrations.

A few things about me:
- I write code in Python, Javascript, Postgresql and Go.
- I can also write Java, C#, Kotlin, C++ and PHP.
- I tried to learn Haskell in my career but it is frickin hard.
- My wishlist is to learn Elixir + Phoenix.
- I liked Django's approach to shipping fast. But for flexibility, I prefer Flask.
- My favorite setup: VSCode/Cursor + VIM extension + tmux in terminal. It works on MacOS and WSL2 in Windows.
- Experienced in deploying end-to-end in Ubuntu for AWS/Azure/DigitalOcean using Cloudflare, NGINX, Postgresql, Redis, Mongodb and a few tools.
- Integrated various APIs from the good ones to bad ones. You can tell a good company based from their API designs. 
- I did work on Figma UX designs.
- I can understand Japanese. I did learned German and Spanish but it's been a long time so I forgot a lot of words.
- Previously, I was employed at Aqwire (fintech), Fortcode (travel, my own startup), Accenture and various projects.

Currently, I am passionate in photography. Check my website if you are curious: [https://onezeronine.dev/](https://onezeronine.dev/)
